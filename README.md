# 2dot_VS
A simple racing game made with SDL and compiled using Visual Studio

This is Version 1.0 of 2Dot, the updated version can be found in the repo: 2dot_Xcode.  I am trying to find time to update this repo (04/09/2019)

This project is meant to be openned with VS, but the compiled version in debug should work.

4/2/19: Found the stuttering issue.  It is a bug in SDL caused by USB devices (any device besides mouse and keyboard).  It causes a stutter every 3000ms
